      <description>For starters, it’s important to only create the data necessary for the test. Ask yourself if you actually need a list of 10 objects, or if 1 or 2 could suffice? Creating objects in the database (and rolling them back after each test) is generally the biggest time-suck in terms of test performance. It’s also worth reviewing your factories and ensuring that they’re not creating more data than they need. This can be especially pervasive since a factory might be used in hundreds of tests without realizing the extent of what other records it creates.</description>

      <description>Doc2 Content If you use external APIs in your app like payment processors, social sites for oauth, or even your own services, the overhead of making an HTTP request and waiting for the response can really weigh down your tests. It can also cause failures if the service is down and inflate your API usage (which can be a big deal if you’re charged per request, or only have some amount of requests available per hour).</description>
